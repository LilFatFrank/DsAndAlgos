Ordered collection of data
Chain of nodes/List of nodes linked together
Each node contain some data along with the reference of the next node
Order of the nodes is always maintained

Special nodes: Head / tail
Tail node does not have a reference to any other node
data in a node can be any type of valid javascript value (string, number, array, object)

Small and Simple Example: 
```const nodeOne = {
    data: 123,
};
const nodeTwo = {
    data: 456,
};
nodeOne.next = nodeTwo;```

linkedList like arrays are zero indexed


==========================================================

In an interview setting, it's absolutely fine to implement genericFunctions like getAt, insertAt, removeAt instead of 'first' and 'last'
