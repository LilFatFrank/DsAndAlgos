parent child relationship between different nodes in a tree
nodes at a similar level can be referred as siblings as long as they have the same parent
iterating through a tree = traversal

unlike a linked list, a tree is not in charge of the elements inside it

============================================================

Breadth-first traversal
>traversing at a similar level

Depth-first traversal
>cover the first children all the way down to its last child, then go back up and do the same for other children
